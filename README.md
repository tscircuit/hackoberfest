Why win one t-shirt when you could win two? [tscircuit](https://tscircuit.com) is an open-source
project where you can build electronic circuit boards with React and Typescript, it's also a great
project to get started with open-source contributions! Why tscircuit is the best project to get
started or refine your open-source contribution skills:

- Our lead maintainer live streams development
daily on [twitter](https://x.com/seveibar), [twitch](https://twitch.tv/seveibar) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@seveibar)
- We have tons of [great first issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Atscircuit+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+is%3Aopen&type=Issues)
